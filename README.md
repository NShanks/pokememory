Well hello there. The goal of this project was to implement useState and useEffect with some api calls. The game isn't perfect and there are edge cases I haven't worked out.
However, I'm going to move on as the advanced game logic isn't necessary to move me towards my goals. The edge case where a user can have 6 correct selections but then
get hit with 6 already selected random pokemon is possible but like I said, a perfectly logical game is not the goal.

If for some reason you aren't me in the future looking back at this project, look out for shinies and enjoy the little react project I made.

I started this on 5/28/2025 sometime in the morning and finished it around 5pm that same day.
